/// Convert a UnsafeRawBufferPointer to UnsafePointer, typically for use with withUnsafeBytes. Its use depends on type inference.

/// Usage example:
///
/// Say that `address` is a pre-existing variable of type `sockaddr`, we can get an UnsafePointer to `address` like this:
///
/// ```
/// let ptr: UnsafePointer<sockaddr>? = UnsafeRawBufferPointerToUnsafePointer(pointer: address)
/// ```
///
/// Internally, this function returns the `baseAddress` of `address`.
