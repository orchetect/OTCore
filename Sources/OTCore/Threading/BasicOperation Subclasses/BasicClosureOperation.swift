/// An `Operation` subclass that adds basic boilerplate for building an operation by supplying a closure as a convenience when further subclassing is not necessary.
///
/// No special method calls are required in the closure.
///
/// `BasicClosureOperation` is not intended to be subclassed. Rather, it is a simple convenience wrapper when a closure is needed to be wrapped in an `Operation` for when you require a reference to the operation which would not otherwise be available if `.addOperation { }` was called directly on an `OperationQueue`.
