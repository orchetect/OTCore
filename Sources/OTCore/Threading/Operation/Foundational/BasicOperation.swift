import Foundation

/// **OTCore:**
/// A synchronous or asynchronous `Operation` subclass that provides essential boilerplate.
/// `BasicOperation` is designed to be subclassed.
///
/// By default this operation is synchronous. If the operation is run without being inserted into an `OperationQueue`, when you call the `start()` method the operation executes immediately in the current thread. By the time the `start()` method returns control, the operation is complete.
///
/// If asynchronous behavior is required then use `BasicAsyncOperation` instead.
///
/// **Usage**
///
/// This object is designed to be subclassed.
///
/// Refer to the following example for calls that must be made within the main closure block:
///
///     class MyOperation: BasicOperation {
///         override func main() {
///             // At the start, call this and conditionally return:
///             guard mainShouldStart() else { return }
///
///             // ... do some work ...
///
///             // Optionally:
///             // If the operation may take more than a few seconds,
///             // periodically check and and return early:
///             if mainShouldAbort() { return }
///
///             // ... do some work ...
///
///             // Finally, at the end of the operation call:
///             completeOperation()
///         }
///     }
///
/// - important: This object is designed to be subclassed. See the Foundation documentation for `Operation` regarding overriding `start()` and be sure to follow the guidelines in these inline docs regarding `BasicOperation` specifically.
