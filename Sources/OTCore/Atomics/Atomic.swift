/// Multiple read accesses can potentially read at the same time, just not during a write.
///
/// By using `pthread` to do the locking, this safer than using a `DispatchQueue/barrier` as there isn't a chance of priority inversion.
///
/// This is safe to use on collection types (`Array`, `Dictionary`, etc.)
