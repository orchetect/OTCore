Multi-platform Swift shared code module with useful extension methods on standard library types.

The library has full unit test coverage and is actively used in production.

## Installation: Swift Package Manager (SPM)

### Dependency within an Application

1. Add the package to your Xcode project using Swift Package Manager using `https://github.com/orchetect/OTCore` as the URL.

2. Import the module files where needed. It's recommended to use the `internal` access level if used in a package so that it is not exported to the user of your package.

   ```swift
   internal import OTCore
   ```

### Dependency within a Swift Package

In your Package.swift file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/orchetect/OTCore", from: "1.7.4")
]
```

## Documentation

Most methods are implemented as category methods so they are generally discoverable.

All methods are documented with inline help explaining their purpose and basic usage examples.
