Foundational multi-platform shared code module with useful extensions on core Swift types.

## Summary

The library functions as a repository of useful extensions on common Swift types.

- Efforts have been made to reduce imports as much as possible, allowing more functions to become available on more compiled platforms.
- Efforts have also been made to make methods as performant and generalized as possible.
- Code has been battle-tested in production software for 1-5 years, and updated/improved as needed periodically.
- Unit tests have been added wherever possible.
